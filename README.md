This is a project I played around with
- a handful of small libraries I threw together, like
  - `Pushy` for reactive-ish behavior
  - a `Layout`(?, may involve more than 1 namespace) library for laying out components whose sizes and offsets are calculated from otehrs
  - and a couple of other smaller ones

The idea was to use those to explore how much of a tile-slicing/editing tool I could make. I don't actually need such a tool, so this was abandoned for greener pastures as I noticed I wasn't learning as much over time, and needed a fresh start.

You can clone this repo, `cd` into it, and do `./dragonruby .`, to try it. It doesn't do a whole lot, but you should be able to progressively select and deselect some tiles
