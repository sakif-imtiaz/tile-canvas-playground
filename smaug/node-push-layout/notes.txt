Things that are weird in here right now:

Elements::Sizing / Dimensions
- Dimensions feels a bit nuts, but its working?
- Could a couple more classes for dimensions help, instead of a dimension class handling relative + absolute dimensions
- Or could more containers help?

Doing stuff with observables may obviate a lot of stuff in Elements
- but i don't want to gut the non-reactive version
- need to be careful
- if they can have some common interface that'd be great. then things

I'm not wild about how statics are built or how they work

I added Pushy::Observable#transformer_result
  Not crazy about using it at all
  And it should have a different name
  And it shouldn't be updated here but in pushy

I use #transformer_result in Column & Serial

I'm subscribing to to things a lot, and I don't love that. I think I can do something about that

Pushy Concerns
    Updates that I need to move over to the actual package
    - Observable#transformer_result
    - Transformers::WithLatestFrom

    Updates That I should build (here or in the actual package)
    - Pushy::Helpers

    Subscription exists, but I'm not sure what to do with it.
    - I think I want to use it for unsubscribing and pausing.
    - I think the values actually currently go through it but I need to check, and have specs
